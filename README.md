# u-bye-ntu
a stupid ubuntu distro. It's a normal ubuntu, except every time it powers on it has a 1/10000 chance to wipe the partition it's on COMPLETELY CLEAN.

## DO NOT INSTALL AS YOUR MAIN OS

this wipes the partition completely clean, so you'll lose all your files. It's also currently untested, so it might have some unexpected. In other words:

## This might wipe your entire system clean. Only run it as a VM.
